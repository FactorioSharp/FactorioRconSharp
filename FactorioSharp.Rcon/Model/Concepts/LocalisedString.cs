/// <summary>
/// Localised strings are a way to support translation of in-game text. It is an array where the first element is the key and the remaining elements are parameters that will be substituted for placeholders in the template designated by the key.
/// 
/// The key identifies the string template. For example, `"gui-alert-tooltip.attack"` (for the template `"__1__
///     objects are being damaged"`; see the file `data/core/locale/en.cfg`).
/// 
/// The template can contain placeholders such as `__1__` or `__2__`. These will be replaced by the respective parameter in the LocalisedString. The parameters themselves can be other localised strings, which will be processed recursively in the same fashion. Localised strings can not be recursed deeper than 20 levels and can not have more than 20 parameters.
/// 
/// There are two special flags for the localised string, indicated by the key being a particular string. First, if the key is the empty string (`""`), then all parameters will be concatenated (after processing, if any are localised strings themselves). Second, if the key is a question mark (`"?"`), then the first valid parameter will be used. A parameter can be invalid if its name doesn't match any string template. If no parameters are valid, the last one is returned. This is useful to implement a fallback for missing locale templates.
/// 
/// Furthermore, when an API function expects a localised string, it will also accept a regular string (i.e. not a table) which will not be translated, as well as a number, boolean or `nil`, which will be converted to their textual representation.
