/// <summary>
/// Candidate chunks are given scores to determine which one of them should be expanded into. This score takes into account various settings noted below. The iteration is over a square region centered around the chunk for which the calculation is done, and includes the central chunk as well. Distances are calculated as [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).
/// 
/// The pseudocode algorithm to determine a chunk's score is as follows:
/// 
/// ```
/// player = 0
/// for neighbour in all chunks within enemy_building_influence_radius from chunk:
///   player += number of player buildings on neighbour
///           * building_coefficient
///           * neighbouring_chunk_coefficient^distance(chunk, neighbour)
/// 
/// base = 0
/// for neighbour in all chunk within friendly_base_influence_radius from chunk:
///   base += num of enemy bases on neighbour
///           * other_base_coefficient
///           * neighbouring_base_chunk_coefficient^distance(chunk, neighbour)
/// 
/// score(chunk) = 1 / (1 + player + base)
/// ```
